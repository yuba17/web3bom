/// ERC4626
/// @dev The vault is compliant with ERC-4626 and with ERC-2612 (permit extension). Though the vault has a
/// non-conventional behaviour on max functions: they always return zero.
/// @dev totalSupply is not updated to include shares minted to fee recipients. One can call accrueInterestView to
/// compute the updated totalSupply.
///
/// TOTAL ASSETS
/// @dev Adapters are responsible for reporting to the vault how much their investments are worth at any time, so that
/// the vault can accrue interest or realize losses.
/// @dev _totalAssets stores the last recorded total assets. Use totalAssets() for the updated total assets.
/// @dev Upon interest accrual, the vault loops through adapters' realAssets(). If there are too many adapters and/or
/// they consume too much gas on realAssets(), it could cause issues such as expensive interactions, even DOS.
///
/// LOSS REALIZATION
/// @dev Loss realization occurs in accrueInterest and decreases the total assets, causing shares to lose value.
/// @dev Vault shares should not be loanable to prevent shares shorting on loss realization. Shares can be flashloanable
/// because flashloan-based shorting is prevented as interests and losses are only accounted once per transaction.
///
/// SHARE PRICE
/// @dev The share price can go down if the vault incurs some losses. Users might want to perform slippage checks upon
/// withdraw/redeem via an other contract.
/// @dev Interest/loss are accounted only once per transaction (at the first interaction with the vault).
/// @dev Donations increase the share price but not faster than the maxRate.
/// @dev The vault has 1 virtual asset and a decimal offset of max(0, 18 - assetDecimals). In order to protect against
/// inflation attacks, the vault might need to be seeded with an initial deposit. See
/// https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc4626#inflation-attack
/// @dev If they make the rate increase by a large factor, donations and forceDeallocate penalties can be in part stolen
/// by opportunistic depositors. Setting a low maxRate prevents that by making the donation/penalty distributed over a
/// long period.
///
/// CAPS
/// @dev Ids have an asset allocation, and can be absolutely capped and/or relatively capped.
/// @dev The allocation is not always up to date, because interest and losses are accounted only when (de)allocating in
/// the corresponding markets.
/// @dev The caps are checked on allocate (where allocations can increase) for the ids returned by the adapter.
/// @dev Relative caps are "soft" in the sense that they are not checked on exit.
/// @dev Caps can be exceeded because of interest.
/// @dev The relative cap is relative to firstTotalAssets, not realAssets.
/// @dev The relative cap unit is WAD.
/// @dev To track allocations using events, use the Allocate and Deallocate events only.
///
/// FIRST TOTAL ASSETS
/// @dev The variable firstTotalAssets tracks the total assets after the first interest accrual of the transaction.
/// @dev Used to implement a mechanism that prevents bypassing relative caps with flashloans. This mechanism makes the
/// caps conservative and can generate false positives, notably for big deposits that go through the liquidity adapter.
/// @dev Also used to accrue interest only once per transaction (see the "share price" section).
/// @dev Relative caps can still be manipulated by allocators (with short-term deposits), but it requires capital.
/// @dev The behavior of firstTotalAssets is different when the vault has totalAssets=0, but it does not matter
/// internally because in this case there are no investments to cap.
///
/// ADAPTERS
/// @dev Loose specification of adapters:
/// - They must enforce that only the vault can call allocate/deallocate.
/// - They must enter/exit markets only in allocate/deallocate.
/// - They must return the right ids on allocate/deallocate. Returned ids must not repeat.
/// - After a call to deallocate, the vault must have an approval to transfer at least `assets` from the adapter.
/// - They must make it possible to make deallocate possible (for in-kind redemptions).
/// - The totalAssets() calculation ignores markets for which the vault has no allocation.
/// - They must not re-enter (directly or indirectly) the vault. They might not statically prevent it, but the curator
/// must not interact with markets that can re-enter the vault.
/// - After an update, the sum of the changes returned after interactions with a given market must be exactly the
/// current estimated position.
/// @dev Ids being reused are useful to cap multiple investments that have a common property.
/// @dev Allocating is prevented if one of the ids' absolute cap is zero and deallocating is prevented if the id's
/// allocation is zero. This prevents interactions with zero assets with unknown markets. For markets that share all
/// their ids, it will be impossible to "disable" them (preventing any interaction) without disabling the others using
/// the same ids.
/// @dev On allocate or deallocate, the adapters might lose some assets (total realAssets decreases), for instance due
/// to roundings or entry/exit fees. This loss should stay negligible compared to gas. Adapters might not statically
/// ensure this, but the curators should not interact with markets that can create big entry/exit losses.
/// @dev Except particular scenarios, adapters should be removed only if they have no assets. In order to ensure no
/// allocator can allocate some assets in an adapter being removed, there should be an id exclusive to the adapter with
/// its cap set to zero.
///
/// ADAPTER REGISTRY
/// @dev An adapter registry can be added to restrict the adapters. This is useful to commit to using only a certain
/// type of adapters for example.
/// @dev If adapterRegistry is set to address(0), the vault can have any adapters.
/// @dev When an adapterRegistry is set, it retroactively checks already added adapters.
/// @dev If the adapterRegistry now returns false for an already added adapter, it doesn't impact the vault's
/// functioning.
/// @dev The invariant that adapters of the vault are all in the registry holds only if the registry cannot remove
/// adapters (is "add only").
///
/// LIQUIDITY ADAPTER
/// @dev Liquidity is allocated to the liquidityAdapter on deposit/mint, and deallocated from the liquidityAdapter on
/// withdraw/redeem if idle assets don't cover the withdrawal.
/// @dev The liquidity adapter is useful on exit, so that exit liquidity is available in addition to the idle assets. But
/// the same adapter/data is used for both entry and exit to have the property that in the general case looping
/// supply-withdraw or withdraw-supply should not change the allocation.
/// @dev If a cap (absolute or relative) associated with the ids returned by the liquidity adapter on the liquidity data
/// is reached, deposit/mint will revert. In particular, when the vault is empty or almost empty, the relative cap check
/// is likely to make deposits revert.
///
/// TOKEN REQUIREMENTS
/// @dev List of assumptions on the token that guarantees that the vault behaves as expected:
/// - It should be ERC-20 compliant, except that it can omit return values on transfer and transferFrom.
/// - The balance of the vault should only decrease on transfer and transferFrom.
/// - It should not re-enter the vault on transfer or transferFrom.
/// - The balance of the sender (resp. receiver) should decrease (resp. increase) by exactly the given amount on
/// transfer and transferFrom. In particular, tokens with fees on transfer are not supported.
///
/// LIVENESS REQUIREMENTS
/// @dev List of assumptions that guarantees the vault's liveness properties:
/// - Adapters should not revert on realAssets.
/// - The token should not revert on transfer and transferFrom if balances and approvals are right.
/// - The token should not revert on transfer to self.
/// - totalAssets and totalSupply must stay below ~10^35. Initially there are min(1, 10^(18-decimals)) shares per asset.
/// - The vault is pinged at least every 10 years.
/// - Adapters must not revert on deallocate if the underlying markets are liquid.
///
/// TIMELOCKS
/// @dev The timelock duration of decreaseTimelock is the timelock duration of the function whose timelock is being
/// decreased (e.g. the timelock of decreaseTimelock(addAdapter, ...) is timelock[addAdapter]).
/// @dev Multiple clashing data can be pending, for example increaseCap and decreaseCap, which can make so accepted
/// timelocked data can potentially be changed shortly afterwards.
/// @dev If a function is abdicated, it cannot be called no matter its timelock and what executableAt[data] contains.
/// Otherwise, the minimum time in which a function can be called is the following:
/// min(
///     timelock[selector],
///     executableAt[selector::_],
///     executableAt[decreaseTimelock::selector::newTimelock] + newTimelock
/// ).
/// @dev Nothing is checked on the timelocked data, so it could be not executable (function does not exist, argument
/// encoding is wrong, function' conditions are not met, etc.).
///
/// ABDICATION
/// @dev When a timelocked function is abdicated, it can't be called anymore.
/// @dev It is still possible to submit data for it or change its timelock, but it will not be executable / effective.
///
/// GATES
/// @dev Set to 0 to disable a gate.
/// @dev Gates must never revert, nor consume too much gas.
/// @dev receiveSharesGate:
///     - Gates receiving shares.
///     - Can lock users out of getting back their shares deposited on an other contract.
/// @dev sendSharesGate:
///     - Gates sending shares.
///     - Can lock users out of exiting the vault.
/// @dev receiveAssetsGate:
///     - Gates withdrawing assets from the vault.
///     - The vault itself (address(this)) is always allowed to receive assets, regardless of the gate configuration.
///     - Can lock users out of exiting the vault.
/// @dev sendAssetsGate:
///     - Gates depositing assets to the vault.
///     - This gate is not critical (cannot block users' funds), while still being able to gate supplies.
///
/// FEES
/// @dev Fees unit is WAD.
/// @dev This invariant holds for both fees: fee != 0 => recipient != address(0).
///
/// ROLES
/// @dev The owner cannot do actions that can directly hurt depositors. Though it can set the curator and sentinels.
/// @dev The curator cannot do actions that can directly hurt depositors without going through a timelock.
/// @dev Allocators can move funds between markets in the boundaries set by caps without going through timelocks. They
/// can also set the liquidity adapter and data, which can prevent deposits and/or withdrawals (it cannot prevent
/// "in-kind redemptions" with forceDeallocate though). Allocators also set the maxRate.
/// @dev Warning: if setIsAllocator is timelocked, removing an allocator will take time.
/// @dev Roles are not "two-step", so anyone can give a role to anyone, but it does not mean that they will exercise it.
///
/// MISC
/// @dev Zero checks are not systematically performed.
/// @dev No-ops are allowed.
/// @dev NatSpec comments are included only when they bring clarity.
/// @dev The contract uses transient storage.
/// @dev At creation, all settings are set to their default values. Notably, timelocks are zero which is useful to set
/// up the vault quickly. Also, there are no gates so anybody can interact with the vault. To prevent that, the gates
/// configuration can be batched with the vault creation.

## TRAMPAS — NO pierdas tiempo en esto
  ⚠ OZ ERC4626 v4.9+ with _decimalsOffset() is protected — check the offset value
  ⚠ Vaults with pre-seeded dead shares in constructor are already mitigated
  ⚠ Some vaults use internal shares that differ from ERC20 totalSupply
  ⚠ Protocols using internal accounting are NOT vulnerable even without virtual shares
  ⚠ Rebasing tokens legitimately change balanceOf — don't flag as donation
  ⚠ Some protocols have intentional donate() functions for yield distribution
  ⚠ 1 wei rounding per operation is expected and acceptable — it is NOT a bug
  ⚠ The bug is when rounding consistently favors the user over the vault
  ⚠ With virtual shares offset, the rounding error per operation is negligible
  ⚠ Fee-on-transfer tokens cause apparent profit from vault perspective — use standard ERC20 for testing
  ⚠ State changes between deposit and redeem (yield accrual) can legitimately change the result — test atomically
  ⚠ Some vaults intentionally revert on zero — that is acceptable per EIP

## CHECKLIST DE INVARIANTES
Run through this when you encounter an ERC-4626 vault. Each "NO" is a lead to investigate.
### First Depositor Protection
- [ ] Does the vault use virtual shares/assets offset (e.g., `_decimalsOffset()`)?
- [ ] OR does it burn MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY to dead address on first mint?
- [ ] OR does it enforce a minimum first deposit amount?
- [ ] If NONE of the above: **vault-001 is likely exploitable**
### Donation Resistance
- [ ] Does `totalAssets()` use internal accounting (not `balanceOf`)?
- [ ] Is there a sweep/skim function for excess donated tokens?
- [ ] Is exchange rate change limited per block?
### Rounding Direction
- [ ] Does `deposit` / `mint` round UP (against user) on assets consumed?
- [ ] Does `withdraw` / `redeem` round DOWN (against user) on assets returned?
- [ ] Is `mulDivUp` used for entry, `mulDivDown` for exit?
- [ ] Do all zero inputs return zero outputs?
- [ ] Do all nonzero inputs produce nonzero outputs?
### Roundtrip Safety
- [ ] Is `redeem(deposit(X))` <= X for any X?
- [ ] Is `deposit(redeem(S))` <= S for any S?
- [ ] Is `mint` cost >= `redeem` yield for same share amount?


### Grep targets adicionales (inputval)
```bash
# Unbounded loops over user input
grep -rn "for.*\.length" src/ --include="*.sol"
grep -rn "while.*length" src/ --include="*.sol"
# Missing zero-address checks
grep -rn "function set\|function update\|function change" src/ --include="*.sol" | grep -i "address"
# Hardcoded zero slippage
grep -rn "amountOutMin.*=.*0\|minAmountOut.*=.*0\|minOut.*=.*0" src/ --include="*.sol"
# Deadline == block.timestamp (no protection)
grep -rn "block.timestamp" src/ --include="*.sol" | grep -i "deadline"
# Unsafe downcasts
grep -rn "uint128(\|uint96(\|uint64(\|uint48(\|uint32(\|int128(\|int96(" src/ --include="*.sol"



## Tu Proceso
1. **Lee CADA línea** del contrato — no te saltes nada
2. **Identifica** las funciones donde tu especialidad (Protocol-specific invariants) es relevante
3. **Genera MÍNIMO 5 invariantes (sin límite superior)** — específicos, no genéricos. 5 es el PISO, no el techo. Si el contrato es complejo, genera 15-20+.
4. **Para cada invariante, lista TODAS las formas de ROMPERLO.** No verifiques que se cumple — asume que NO se cumple y busca CÓMO. Algunos ángulos que NO debes olvidar (pero no te limites a estos):
   - Manipular el estado ANTES de que se evalúe (donation, front-running, flash loan, oracle manipulation)
   - Encontrar otro path que no pasa por el check (otra función, callback, delegatecall, contrato externo)
   - Valores extremos (0, 1, type(uint256).max, dust amounts)
   - Timing inesperado (primer depositor, mid-liquidation, paused state, pool vacío)
   - Combinar con otra función del mismo protocolo (stake+withdraw en 1 tx, borrow+liquidate self)
5. **Para cada invariante**: escribe el Solidity del body (sin firma de función)
6. **Clasifica** tier (1=bug confirmado si falla, 2=revisar, 3=solo optimización)
7. **Investiga y descarta** hipótesis débiles — mejor 3 buenas que 10 mediocres

## Schema del Archivo de Salida
El archivo DEBE seguir el schema de `hunt_session/hypotheses/hyp_template.yaml`.
ID prefix para este componente: `VV` (ej: VV-01, VV-02...)

## Output Requerido
**Escribe tu análisis en**: `/home/kali/Documents/Web3/hunt_session/hypotheses/hyp_VaultV2_DomainHunter.yaml`

Ejemplo de invariante bien formado:
```yaml
- id: VV-01
  tier: 1
  type: property
  description: "Descripción exacta del invariante"
  attack_scenario: "Si falla, un atacante puede extraer X fondos haciendo Y"
  solidity: |
    uint256 current = contract.value();
    gte(current, previous, "VV-01: value decreased");
  validated: true
  priority: high
  confidence: 80
```

## Symmetric Inspection (OBLIGATORIO — después de tu análisis de dominio)
Identifica TODOS los pares simétricos del contrato. Pares comunes:
  deposit/withdraw, mint/burn, lock/unlock, stake/unstake, borrow/repay, open/close

Para CADA par, verifica estas 5 dimensiones:
1. **State variables**: ¿ambas funciones actualizan las mismas variables (en dirección opuesta)?
2. **Validaciones**: ¿mismas validaciones (o su inversa lógica)?
3. **Events**: ¿ambas emiten el evento correspondiente?
4. **Modifiers**: ¿mismos modifiers aplicados (nonReentrant, whenNotPaused)?
5. **Edge cases**: ¿amount=0, amount=max, balance=0 manejados simétricamente?

Cualquier asimetría es un candidato a invariante. Documenta qué variable/check/event falta en qué función.
Bug real: GMX — openShort actualizaba globalShortAveragePrices, closeShort NO → $42M.

## Constraint Inference (0xRajeev — OBLIGATORIO)
Para cada validación/require que encuentres:
1. Observa qué se valida en N-1 code paths que hacen algo similar.
2. El path que NO tiene esa validación es el bug candidato.
Ejemplo: si 5 de 6 funciones de withdraw verifican healthFactor, la 6ta que no lo hace es sospechosa.

## Traza Hacia Atrás (samczsun — MENTALIDAD)
No empieces preguntando "¿hay un bug aquí?". Empieza preguntando:
"¿De dónde puede SALIR valor del protocolo?" (withdraw, redeem, liquidate, claim, transfer).
Para cada punto de salida, traza HACIA ATRÁS: ¿qué condiciones se deben cumplir? ¿Se pueden manipular?

## Reglas Críticas
- **Sin genéricos**: "el contrato podría tener reentrancy" NO es un invariante
- **Con ataque concreto**: especifica exactamente cómo se perdería dinero
- **Confidence honesto**: si no estás seguro al 60%+, marca validated: false
- **False positives**: si investigas algo y es by design, añádelo a false_positives con la lección
